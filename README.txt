INTYODUCTION:
St. Charles Community College (SCC) has recently approved the Room Scheduler Project to enhance schedule coordination throughout the campus.  In order to provide quicker updates, better feedback, and expend fewer resources for SCC, the Room Scheduler Project will focus on building a program that automatically updates a class¡¯ schedule and rooms in a more user-friendly way.  It is essential that SCC utilizes the Room Scheduler program as a background application to gather the data and automatically update the classroom schedules on a wide scale as well as for informing the Schedule Coordinator about new developments, information about the rooms, and other specific information.  SCC realizes how much time is spent scheduling rooms and would like to implement a more timely solution.  In order to accomplish this, SCC seeks to outsource the design, testing, implementation, and training staff for use of this application.  SCC anticipates that this new software will help keep track of important information to keep the College up to date with the newest room schedule information.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The period of performance for the Room Schedule Project is 4 months beginning on February 3rd, 2016 through May 12th, 2016.  All work must be scheduled to complete within this timeframe.  Any modifications or extensions will be requested through SCC and A.C.K. contracting officers for review and discussion.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE 

A.C.K will provide for the Room Schedule Project to perform a majority of the work at their own establishments or any other agreed upon area.  The company will be required to meet at SCC¡¯s facility on agreed upon dates for an update at the project meeting.  Additionally, all project reviews will be held at SCC facility and attended by A.C.K project members. SCC will arrange for meeting spaces within its facility for all required update and project meetings.  Once the project reaches the implementation phase, all implementations will be conducted at SCC¡¯s facility.
